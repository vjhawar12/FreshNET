# Overview

FreshNET is a convolutional neural network that implements the architectural principles outlined in the MobiletNET research paper, "MobileNets: Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Vision Applications" by Howard et al. Using Depthwise Seperable Convolutions and skip connections, the model is relatively lean while performing with ___ accuracy on the ~40k fresh/rotten fruits and vegetables dataset it was trained on. 

# Motivation

As part of my project D.E.L.P.H.I (check the other repo), I needed a lightweight but high-accuracy computer vision system which could distinguish between fresh and rotten fruits and vegetables. After looking into possible implementations, I learned about MobileNET and how its optimized for edge devices. I studied the research paper and investigated the architecture which led me to develop FreshNET, an adaptation of MobileNET specifically for fresh/rotten fruit classification on edge devices.
