Overview

FreshNET is a convolutional neural network that follows the main architectural principles (like Depthwise Seperable Convolutions and skip connections) outlined in the MobiletNET research paper, "MobileNets: Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Vision Applications" by Howard et al. The model is trained on a ~40k image dataset of fresh/rotten fruits and vegetables and performs binary classication.
